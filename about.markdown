Hi, I am Satya Krishna Gorti. I graduated with MSc. in Applied Computing from University of Toronto. My main interests lie in the area of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I am currently a Machine Learning Research Scientist at [Layer6 AI](https://layer6.ai) where I work on local and global methods for large-scale image retrieval. Previous to this, I was a Research Intern at [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/) working on multi-object tracking using LIDAR and RADAR sensors for self-driving vehicles.

I am also very interested in programming language design. Professionally I have used Python, Java, Scala and JavaScript. Lately I have been dabbling a lot with C++ a lot in my free time. In the past I have also used SML, Elixir and Ruby for various pet projects.
